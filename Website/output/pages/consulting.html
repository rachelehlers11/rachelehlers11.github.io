<h4>Scientific Research</h4>
<p><strong>Predicting Post-Traumatic Epilepsy in Patients with Traumatic Brain Injuries (University of Montana Big Data Projects Course, partnered with N-Site LLC)</strong></p>
<p>I was one of a team of 3 University of Montana mathematics students tasked with analyzing electroencephalogram data from patients diagnosed with traumatic brain injuries. A number of these patients went on to develop post-traumatic epilepsy. We performed exploratory analysis formed predictive models for PTE and </p>
<p>A summary of our methods and results can be found on pages 13-18 of the following link:

<p><strong>Using <em>Chlamydomonas Reinhardtii</em> as a Bioremediation Agent in Water Contaminated by Arsenic</strong></p>
<p>Over a nine-month period, I designed and implemented an experiment to investigate the use of <em>Chlamydomonas Reinhardtii</em> (a type of algae) in cleaning water contaminated by arsenic. This included conducting background research, experiment design, lab work, data collection, statistical analysis, and hypothesis testing. 
I was selected as a finalist for the 2013 Intel International Science and Engineering Fair in Phoenix, AZ. There, I presented my research to a panel of judges, competing against students from over 75 countries. The abstract for my experiment can be found on page 143 of the following link.
