<p>Coaching amateurs can be a lucrative endeavor. In 2016, the top-earning public employee in 27 states was an NCAA Division-I FBS football coach; in 12 others, it was a D-I college basketball coach. For those unfamiliar with the kind of money these individuals rake in: Alabama will have paid Nick Saban a whopping \$11.125 million dollars by the end of the year. With the exception of 2016, he’s been the highest earner each year since 2012. The one hiccup in his would-be 7-year streak was the result of Jim Harbaugh’s \$9 million deal with Michigan. While these salaries are arguably excessive (even Saban said, “probably not” when asked if he was worth $11 million this year), they provide a way to estimate  insight into how much schools are willing to pay to get the top talent and keep them from straying. </p>
<p>What about the rest of the staff? Each team is allowed 9 paid assistant coaches. Curious about trends in salary distribution across teams and conferences, I began to search for a reliable source of data, finding one in USA Today. Since 2014, USA Today has requested and published coaching staff compensation from all FBS schools. Private schools are exempt from reporting such information, but coach salary data is available from almost every public FBS school. The most up-to-date salary data can be found at the links at the end of this post. I found data from 2014-2016 using the <a href="http://archive.org/web/">Wayback Machine</a>. I scraped and parsed the data using the Python libraries requests and BeautifulSoup. I structured and cleaned it using pandas. For visualization and analysis, I played around with both R and Python. For runnable Python code, go check out my accompanying notebook.</p>
<p>Before analyzing this data, my knowledge of FBS coach salaries was limited to seeing headlines about Jim Harbaugh and Nick Saban. I knew essentially nothing about what assistant coaches were paid. I attended an FCS school, so for the past four years I've been more familiar with football at that level.</p>
<p>7 of the top 10 assistant coach salaries in 2017 were paid to coaches at SEC schools. LSU's Dave Aranda was the top earner, pulling in $1,800,000
The most reliable variable for comparison is school pay, because it's available for nearly every coach on the list, and there are few errsThe first thing I did was make boxplots of </p>
<p>Power Five Conferences seemed to be on another level compared to teams in other conferences. Conferences belonging to the Power Five are the ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12, and SEC. </p>

<p>For those who would like to follow along with the code and process of scraping, cleaning, and visualizing the data, check out my accompanying blog post. It's a Jupyter notebook, so the code is executable in your browser. Even if you've never coded before, I strongly encourage you to try it out. I provided step-by-step directions of how to run code, alter it, and then see what you built. </p>
