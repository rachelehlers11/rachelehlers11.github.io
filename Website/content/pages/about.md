Title: About
Hi, my name is Rachel Ehlers. I'm a mathematician from Montana. 


In May I graduated from the University of Montana, earning my bachelor's in mathematics with a focus in statistics, a minor in economics, and a certificate in big data analytics. 

I started this blog to share data science projects, art, and whatever else I feel like talking about. 
My other interests include music, art, film.

In my spare time I like to play the piano, spend time at Flathead Lake, and hike with my dog, Dali.
