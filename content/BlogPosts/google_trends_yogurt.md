Summary: Greek Yogurt and Kale?


---------------------------

I recently came to the realization that I've only known about Greek yogurt (more appropriately named "strained yogurt") since high school. After I started eating it, I essentially stopped eating "regular" yogurt altogether. It seemed like it became popular overnight; suddenly brands like Chobani and Fage became popular, and brands who were still primarily making unstrained yogurt rushed to add Greek yogurt to their lineup.


I wanted to know when Greek yogurt replaced the soupy, unstrained stuff. I guessed Greek yogurt became popular (at least in the U.S.) around 2010-2012. That was simply because it was around the time I started using Pinterest. The folks on that site were constantly posting about its health benefits or sharing recipes in which it'd be used as a substitute for more delicious things, like sour cream or cream cheese. I checked out Google Trends to see if I was right about its sudden popularity.

Search volume climbed dramatically each year from 2010 to 2014, peaking in January 2014. From 2015 on, maximum and minimum search volume have remained at steady levels.

Reducing the Trends time period to the past 5 years yields an interesting visual. Each year, the minimum search volume falls on the week of Christmas (or the one before). The volume dip is closely followed by a jump in volume in early to mid-January.

January is, of course, the time to put the poor life decisions you made during the holiday season behind you and pretend you're making a change in your life. Something about the turn of the Gregorian calendar tricks people into thinking they're much more driven than they are. Of course, even though it's winter, the optimal time to be out of shape, one of the most common New Year's resolutions is to lose weight (or "get in shape", "live a healthier lifestyle", or some other variation). This is the perfect time for health fads to become popular. To confirm my suspicion that Greek yogurt trends in such a manner due to lifestyle changes en masse, I looked up other phrases I expected to trend similarly.

Google Trends is one of my favorite research tools, and it's simple to use. I'm making a 3/4-year resolution to keep this blog alive, so check back for more posts about Google Trends and other data I find interesting.
