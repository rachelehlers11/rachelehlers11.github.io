Hi, my name is Rachel Ehlers. I'm a data scientist living in Portland and working at [Swift](http://www.swift.co/), a creative agency. I started this blog to share data science projects and anything else I feel like talking about.

I graduated from the University of Montana in 2017, earning my B.A. in mathematics with an option in statistics, an economics minor, and a certificate in big data analytics. My other interests include music, art, and film. In my spare time I like to play the piano and run with my dog, Dali.
