Hi, my name is Rachel Ehlers. I'm a mathematician from Montana. I started this blog to share data science projects and anything else I feel like talking about.

In May I graduated from the University of Montana, earning my: 

- B.A. in Mathematics (Statistics Option)
- Economics minor
- Big Data Analytics Certificate

My other interests include music, art, and film. In my spare time I like to play the piano, spend time at Flathead Lake, and hike with my dog, Dali.
